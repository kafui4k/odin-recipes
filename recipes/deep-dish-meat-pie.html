        <ol>
            <li>
                Place meat, onion, and potatoes in a small Dutch oven; add water to cover. 
                Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until vegetables are tender. Add 
                salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refrigerate for 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine flour and water; stir until smooth. Gradually add to meat mixture; cook 
                over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cool and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll half of pastry to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface; fit into 
                a deep 9-inch pie plate. Pour meat mixture into pastry shell. Roll out remaining 
                pastry to 1/8-inch thickness; place over filling. Trim edges; seal and flute. 
                Cut slits in top to allow steam to escape. Bake at 350Â° for 45 minutes or until 
                golden brown.
